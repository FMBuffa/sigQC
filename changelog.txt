10/06/2017/Version 1.10: Fixed outptutting of radarchart_table.txt for consistency. Rowname format now standardised to have '.' replacing spaces in the signature name or dataset name and have an '_' between the signature and dataset name.
31/05/2017/Version 1.09: Added error checking to ensure that every gene signature has at least 2 elements, and that every dataset contains at least 2 expressed elemetns of each signature, otherwise the signature/dataset is removed.
30/05/2017/Version 1.08: Numerous bug fixes, added underscores to headers of output tables, rank product now outputting for all genes, fix for complexheatmap issue with differing numbers of rows.
29/05/2017/Version 1.07: Numerous bug fixes, automated legend placement/margins resizing for autocorrelation heatmaps, added proportion of variance explained by first PCA to radarplot.
17/05/2017/Version 1.06: Updates to rankProduct calculation, origin parameter error checking, removal of logged parameter, and improvements to legend placement in radarplot.
16/05/2017/Version 1.05: Further bug fix re: Rankproduct function; added parameters to main function: logged - T/F if data was log transformed or not (required) and origin - character vector of different origins of datasets, default is assumption that all datasets are same origin (both used for rankproduct).
16/05/2017/Version 1.04: Small bug fix re: Rankproduct function
15/05/2017/Version 1.03: Small bug fix re: handling of matrices with high concentrations of NA values - able to bypass these values to prevent errors.
13/05/2017/Version 1.02: Small bug fix re: Coefficient of variance ratio in radar plot; added absolute values to maintain range in [0,1].
12/05/2017/Version 1.01: Small bug fix re: calculating proportion of expressed/NA genes, accounting for genes not present as rownnames in the dataset.
11/05/2017/Version 1.00: Base version.
