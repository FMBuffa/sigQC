\usage{
make_all_plots(gene_sigs_list, mRNA_expr_matrix, names_sigs = NULL,
  names_datasets = NULL, covariates = NULL, thresholds = NULL,
  out_dir = "~", showResults = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{gene_sigs_list}{A list of genes representing the gene signature to be tested.}

\item{mRNA_expr_matrix}{A list of expression matrices}

\item{names_sigs}{The names of the genes in the signature}

\item{names_datasets}{The names of the different datasets contained in mRNA_expr_matrix}

\item{covariates}{A list containing a sub-list of 'annotations' and 'colors' which contains the annotation matrix for the given dataset and the associated colours with which to plot in the expression heatmap}

\item{thresholds}{A list of thresholds to be considered for each data set, default is median of the data set. A gene is considered expressed if above the threshold, non-expressed otherwise.}

\item{out_dir}{A path to the directory where the resulting output files are written}

\item{showResults}{Tells if open dialog boxes showing the computed results. Default is FALSE}
